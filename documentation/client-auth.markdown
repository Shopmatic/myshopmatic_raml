# USAGE

At first, you have to get `Client Key` from `POST /client-keys` with form data `uuid=abcdefg`.

  - Each uuid (device) only have one client key, new one will replace old one if `POST /client-keys` again with the same uuid.

Puts following keys in request headers for each API:

- `X-SHOPMATIC-UUID`: uuid from each mobile device.
- `X-SHOPMATIC-TS`: current timestamp (integer) of UTC time.
- `X-SHOPMATIC-CS`: generated by following code sample:

```
md5(client_key + uuid + timestamp)
```

To test and debug, You can try this endpoint:
`GET https://api.staging-domain.com/?format=json`

# SUPER MODE

This mode only for staging and development ENV.
For skipping client authentication, you can set `X-SHOPMATIC-CS` value to `5xrubygogogo` only, and server will pass the authentication.

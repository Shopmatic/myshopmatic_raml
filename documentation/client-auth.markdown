# USAGE

Puts following keys in request headers for each API:

- `X-SHOPMATIC_UUID`: uuid from each mobile device.
- `X-SHOPMATIC_TS`: current timestamp (integer) of UTC time.
- `X-SHOPMATIC_CS`: generated by following code sample:

```
md5(SECRET_KEY + uuid + timestamp)
```
`SECRET_KEY`: HARD in code! Please contact your boss :)

To test and debug, You can try this endpoint:
`GET https://api.staging-domain.com/?format=json`

# SUPER MODE

This mode only for staging and development ENV.
For skipping client authentication, you can set `SHOPMATIC_CS` value to `5xrubygogogo` only, and server will pass the authentication.
